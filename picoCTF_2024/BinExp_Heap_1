# Heap 1

## Problem

Heap 1 is very similar to Heap 0. We are given the same interface: a program that allows us to input a value to be written to the heap, with the goal of overwriting the data at a variable safe_var. 

The difference is in what value is expected at the location of safe_var.

## Approach

Let's examine the source code. There is a small difference in the check_win() function. Whereas in Heap 0 safe_var needs to be not equal to "bico", in Heap 1 safe_var must be equal to "pico".

Thus our goal is to write the value "pico" at the location of safe_var on the heap.

We already determined in Heap 0 that writing at least 32 characters to the heap will overwrite data stored at the location of safe_var. Now, all we need to do is write the string "pico" into the location of safe_var. So, we can write 32 characters, plus the string "pico".
