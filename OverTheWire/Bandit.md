## Introduction

## Level 0

Connect to the server specified in the Level 0 description. To connect to an ssh server, use the command $ssh <user>@<domain> -p<port_number>.

To find the password for Level 1, read the file "readme". For example, use the *cat* command.

## Level 1

We need to research how to open (or reference) a file with the filename "-", which is treated as a special character.

One possible way to view the contents of the file is to reference it as *./-*.

## Level 2

Similar to the last level, we need to reference a file with special characters in the filename - this time containing spaces.

One possibility is to surround the filename in double quotes: "./spaces in this filename".
