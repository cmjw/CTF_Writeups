## Approach

A proof of concept at https://github.com/ProDefense/CVE-2025-32433 can be used to demonstrate the severity of this vulnerability.

First, follow the steps to complete the exploit. To verify the payload has been transferred to the server, we can replace the code that creates the file lab.txt with a command to print out its contents.

For the subsequent questions, we can modify the command sent to the victim machine. First, we can list the contenst of root (/), and cat out the contents of the flag. Similarly, we can send a command to print the hostname of the system.
