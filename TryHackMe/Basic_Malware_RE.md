# Basic Malware RE

## Part 1

Download and extract the .zip archive- the password is in the first task description (I did so in a virtual machine).

I first listed the string values in the executable using the *strings* function. This lists several flag-formatted values among other strings. One of these is likely the flag, but we don't know which one yet.

Next, I opened the program in Ghidra. Navigating to the entry point - the entry() function - we can see there is a string value moved to %eax and pushed onto the stack. Then the md5sum function is called, indicating this string value is probably a parameter to it.

In the decompiled view of entry(), we can see our intuition is correct. We see the md5_hash function is called with this flag-formatted string as a parameter. 

Searching for this value in the string view, we can find the full value of the flag.
